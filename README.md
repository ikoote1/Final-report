**Subject: Task Completion and Feedback on Admin Panel**

Dear Agnes and the YooKatale Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm excited to inform you that I have successfully completed the first task assigned to me. It was a fulfilling experience to edit the images and add all the items to the application using the provided admin panel. I must say, I truly enjoyed navigating through the panel and exploring its functionalities.

During the process, I encountered a few points that I believe would enhance the user experience and the overall functionality of the admin panel:

1. **Quantity Field in Add Item Form:** I noticed that the quantity field is not currently provided in the add item form. Including this field would allow for better inventory management and ensure accurate availability tracking.

2. **Form Submission and Display Issue:** After clicking the submit button, the form does not close automatically, and the previously added data remains visible. This could potentially lead to accidental duplication of items if the submit button is clicked multiple times. Implementing a clear form reset or an intuitive success notification after submission could resolve this issue.

I'm also thrilled to share my thoughts on using the admin panel:

The admin panel provided a seamless and organized way to manage the products. Its user-friendly interface allowed for easy navigation and efficient data entry. I was particularly impressed by the clear categorization of items, which makes managing a wide range of products straightforward. The ability to upload images and input details through a single form simplified the process significantly.

Moving forward, I'm eager to tackle the next phases of the assessment and contribute to YooKatale's vision. I am interested in gaining access to the GitHub repository, as mentioned in the initial communication. It would be a great opportunity for me to delve deeper into the technical aspects and work collaboratively on enhancing the platform.

Lastly, I observed that the home product page currently displays items from all categories in the same order they were added. While this provides an overview of available products, it might be beneficial to explore options for categorizing and organizing the products, making it easier for users to find what they're looking for.

Thank you for considering my feedback. I'm excited to continue the assessment journey and contribute my skills to YooKatale's innovative digital mobile food market.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Ikoote Rasuli
